#Derpypad

##About

Derpypad is a semi hand wired, semi home milled pc bluetooth numberpad made to work
adafruit's 32u4 Bluefruit Feather. There's some problems with the bluetooth (not sure if firmware or my end) but it's mostly functional. I'll upload the kicad files eventually to my github profile
and move this to handwired keyboard folder as well.
